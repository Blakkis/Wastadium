# Wastadium
Topdown shooter with high moddability and in-built mapeditor
I did all the models in Blender which were then rendered using ortho camera
(Models are included in the blend directory)

inspiration comes from an old game called "TapanKaikki" by ErrorFree
This is was really great project to work on.
I only did one campaign for game which is fairly challenging
took me about 1 and half to write the game + editor and do all the models + mapping
overall, happy with the result
